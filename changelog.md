# ChangeLog
## Version 0.5.5.BETA
Release page: https://modrinth.com/mod/ruined-worlds/version/0.5.5.BETA <br/>
Working towards the "Scrap Update"! A few things have added and many are to come! But here a small summary:
#### New Things
* Scrap
* Scrap Metal
* Bunch Of Scrap
* A new structure: Scrap Pallet
* Gas Barrel
* Road Sign
* Metal Pipe
* A Guide and Update book/dictionary
#### Changes
* Changed the model of the Oil Barrel of a 3D version
#### Other Notes
* Translation are left untouched. This is because many new things are added in a small period of time, meaning it gets too chaotic to comfortably add translations.
## Version 0.5.2.BETA
Release page: https://modrinth.com/mod/ruined-worlds/version/0.5.2.BETA<br/>
The first ever release of Ruined Worlds. This added many of the basic things like 10 structures, some food, armor & tools and many more things!

What will the next version bring? Version 0.6.0 will be called the "Scrap Update" which will add many new things, including items, a village and a new workbench! But it'll be divided into multiple little updates. As of now, update Version 0.6.0 (Which will be released soon) will bring mostly items, some new blocks and possibly a new structure!

This is the checklist we're currently over going:
- [ ] Adding multiple items like Scrap and other parts!
- [ ] Adding a new structure!
- [ ] Adding a new village!
- [ ] Making the Recycler work!
